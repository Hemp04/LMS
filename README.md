# Library Management System in Java (Incubyte Assessment)

This is a simple library management system entirely implemented using a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, and viewing available books.

## What is TDD ?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach in which tests are written before the actual code is implemented. The process follows a cyclical pattern known as Red-Green-Refactor:

Red: Write a test for a specific functionality that doesnâ€™t exist yet. Run the test, and it should fail (indicated by the "red" status), as the code to pass the test hasn't been written.

Green: Write the minimal amount of code necessary to pass the test. This is typically quick and simple, just enough to make the test pass (indicated by the "green" status).

Refactor: Clean up the code while ensuring that all tests still pass. Refactoring involves improving the code structure, removing duplications, and enhancing readability without altering the external behavior.

### Benefits of TDD:
  Improved Code Quality: TDD ensures that code is thoroughly tested, leading to fewer bugs and better design.
  Confidence in Code: Developers can confidently make changes, knowing that any regression or issues will be caught by the tests.
  Better Design: Writing tests first forces developers to think about the design and interface of the code, often resulting in a more modular and flexible codebase.
  Documentation: Tests serve as documentation for how the code is supposed to work.
  
### In summary, TDD is a disciplined method of ensuring that software is well-tested, well-designed, and maintainable by writing tests before coding.
